# DMart-Sales-Analysis

Project Overview
The D-Mart Sales Analysis Project aims to analyze and predict sales for a large retail chain, BigMart, using historical sales data collected from 2013. The dataset includes sales information for 1559 products across 10 stores in various cities. Each product and store has multiple attributes that could influence sales performance. The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the sales of each product at specific outlets, thereby uncovering key factors that contribute to sales increases.

Dataset
The dataset consists of sales data for the year 2013 and includes the following key elements:

Products: 1559 different products with various attributes such as product ID, category, MRP, etc.
Stores: 10 stores located in different cities, each with attributes such as store ID, location, type, and size.
Sales Data: Sales figures for each product at each store.
Additional Attributes: Various other attributes that could affect sales, such as store visibility, product weight, etc.


Data Characteristics

Missing Values: Some data entries may be incomplete due to technical glitches or non-reporting by some stores.
Feature Types: Includes numerical features (e.g., MRP, sales) and categorical features (e.g., product category, store type).

The missing values are handled by taking the mean and mode of the Item Weight and Outlet Size respectively of the Test dataset.
